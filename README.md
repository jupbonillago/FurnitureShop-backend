## Introduction

FurnitureShop Backend is a .NET-based application developed in C# to handle the backend operations of the FurnitureShop project. This backend is responsible for processing client requests, generating furniture blueprints using AutoCAD, and providing the necessary data to the Vue.js-based front end.
